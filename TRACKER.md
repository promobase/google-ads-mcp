# Google Ads MCP Service Implementation Tracker

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of all Google Ads API v20 services in the MCP server.
Goal: 1:1 mapping of ALL Google Ads services with full type safety using generated protobuf types.

## Progress Summary
- Total Services: 106 (from google-ads-python v20)
- ✅ Implemented: 58 (54.7%)
- ❌ Not Implemented: 48 (45.3%)

## Implementation Notes
- Some services are named differently in our implementation (e.g., `budget` instead of `campaign_budget`, `search` for partial `google_ads`)
- All implementations must use v20 generated protobuf types for full type safety

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Type Safety**: All implementations MUST use generated protobuf types from google-ads-python v20
2. **Testing**: Each service MUST have comprehensive tests covering all operations
3. **Structure**: Follow existing pattern in `src/sdk_services/` organized by category
4. **MCP Tools**: Create lightweight MCP tool wrappers for each service operation
5. **Documentation**: Include service description and available operations
6. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling with meaningful messages

## Implementation Checklist for Each Service

- [ ] Review the protobuf types in `google-ads-python/google/ads/googleads/v20/services/types/`
- [ ] Implement all service methods with full type annotations
- [ ] Create MCP tool wrappers in `src/sdk_servers/`
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests in `tests/`
- [ ] Run `uv run ruff format .` and `uv run pyright`
- [ ] Update this tracker with ✅ status
- [ ] Add to `main.py` imports

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Create this TRACKER.md file
2. 🔄 Audit existing implementations for full type safety compliance
3. 📋 Start implementing high-priority services
4. 🛠️ Ensure all implementations use v20 generated types
5. 📊 Track progress and update this document

## Notes for Other Agents

When picking up work:
1. Check this tracker for current status and priority
2. Update "Current Task Status" when starting a service
3. Follow the implementation checklist above
4. Use the existing code patterns as reference
5. Ensure full type safety with v20 protobuf types
6. Update this tracker immediately after completing each service
